ng generate pipe pipes/new-pipe
```

For a complete list of available schematics, run:
```bash
ng generate --help
```

### Building

Build the project for different environments:

```bash
# Development build
ng build

# Production build
ng build --configuration production
```

Build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests

Run unit tests with Karma:

```bash
ng test
```

### End-to-End Tests with Playwright

This project uses Playwright for end-to-end testing, providing reliable and fast testing across multiple browsers.

```

#### Running Tests

Before running tests, install dependencies and Playwright browsers:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
```

Run all tests:
```bash
# Run all tests (both feature and mock tests)
npm run test:all

# Run all tests with debug logging
npm run test:debug
```

Run feature tests:
```bash
# Run feature tests with default browser
npm run test:features

# Run feature tests with specific tags
npm run test:features -- --tags "@smoke"

# Run feature tests for specific browsers
npm run test:chrome      # Chrome only
npm run test:firefox     # Firefox only
npm run test:webkit      # WebKit only

# Run feature tests in headed mode
npm run test:headed

# Run feature tests with UI mode
npm run test:ui
```

Run mock tests:
```bash
# Run API mock tests
npm run test:mock

# Run mock tests in debug mode
npm run test:mock:debug

# Run mock tests in UI mode
npm run test:mock:ui
```

#### Test Reports

Generate and view test reports:

```bash
# Generate all test reports
npm run report:generate

# Open HTML test report
npm run report:open

# Clean previous reports
npm run report:clean

# Generate and open reports in one command
npm run report:all
```

#### Additional Scripts
npm run check:types

# Lint check
npm run lint

# Clean test reports
npm run clean:reports
```

```

The HTML report includes:
- Test execution summary
- Test case details with steps
- Screenshots of failures
- Trace viewer for debugging
- Performance metrics

#### Configuration

Playwright configuration is in `playwright.config.ts`:
- Multiple browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Parallel test execution
- Automatic screenshots on failure
- Trace recording for debugging
- Custom test timeout settings
- Global setup and teardown hooks

#### CI/CD Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery. The pipeline is configured in `.github/workflows/bookstore-ci.yml`.

##### Pipeline Structure

The CI/CD pipeline consists of three main jobs:

1. **Build and Test**
   - Runs on Ubuntu latest
   - Sets up Node.js 18.x environment
   - Installs dependencies and Playwright browsers
   - Builds the application
   - Runs unit tests
   - Uploads test coverage reports

2. **Playwright Tests**
   - Depends on successful build
   - Runs in parallel using matrix strategy (3 shards)
   - Executes both Playwright and Cucumber tests
   - Supports multiple operating systems (currently Ubuntu)
   - Uploads test results and reports

3. **Test Report Publication**
   - Combines all test results
   - Generates a unified test report
   - Publishes results using test-reporter
   - Uploads combined report as artifact

##### Trigger Events
The pipeline runs on:
- Push to main and develop branches
- Pull requests to main and develop branches

##### Test Artifacts
The following artifacts are generated and stored:
- Unit test results (coverage/)
- Playwright test results (playwright-report/)
- Test execution traces (test-results/)
- Combined test report (test-report/)

##### Dependencies Installation
```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
npx playwright install-deps
```

## 📚 Documentation

The application is built using Angular's best practices and follows a component-based architecture:

- Components are organized by feature
- Services handle data management and API calls
- Models define the structure of book and category data
- Routing enables smooth navigation between views
